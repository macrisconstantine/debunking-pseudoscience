# debunking-pseudoscience
- This game/simulator was made in Unity as my creative final project for the honors course Debunking Pseudoscience.
- In this game/simulator, the user controls a spaceship to explore the physics of the universe.
- In the pause menu, the player can customize some of the universe's physical laws.
- Visiting other planets provides the user with real facts about those planets.
- The larger planets enforce a proportionally strong gravitational pull on the spaceship.
